GRAPHICAL HANGMAN v1

9 - 17 - 2018

UPDATE: I won't be updating this so if someone wants to have at it and make it their own they are more than welcome.
It isn't set up for any kind of packaging at all and I assume that if someone wants to play it they'll install python and
pygame and use these resources to run it themselves. I'm just not advanced enough to package a game myself yet. 

This game is a simple Hangman game made with Python, the pygame library, and a few free tools for making art and sound.
For the art I mostly used Piskel which is an easy way to make pixel art for sprites. For the sound I used a mixture
of bfxr and Bosca Ceoil, both of which are free and easy to use. 

Notes on tinkering with my code: It's way overly complicated and someone willing to take the time and just refactor it
would have a neat little something on their hands, although it might just be easier to make one from scratch. I simply
did not use good coding practices in most of this code, but it works and that might be useful to someone. Enjoy!

MANDATORY DISCLAIMER: This is just a game of hangman. It is not controversial. If anyone finds it controversial please let me 
know and I will immediately take it down. It seemed like a cool first thing to code to completion with pygame.
